    trends, and relationships in the data. This information can be used to improve decision-making and to develop strategies for the future.


4. Explain Predictive analytics?
Ans. Predictive analytics is a type of business intelligence that uses statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze historical 
	data and make predictions about future events. 


5. Explain perspective analytics?
Ans. Perspective analytics, also known as prescriptive analytics, is a type of advanced business intelligence that uses a combination of data, 
     statistical models, and optimization techniques to generate recommendations and suggest specific actions to improve business outcomes. 


6. Write five real-life questions that PowerBi can solve.
Ans. Five real-life questions that PowerBi can solve are as follows:-
       1. How is our marketing campaign performing, and which channels are driving the most conversions?
          	Power BI can be used to connect to marketing data, create visualizations such as line charts and bar charts to show campaign performance 
          	over time, and also use data mining techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data to understand which channels are driving 
          	the most conversions.

       2.  How is the website traffic performing, and which pages are the most popular?
		Power BI can be used to connect to website analytics data, create visualizations such as line charts and heat maps to show website traffic over time, 
		and also use data mining techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data to understand which pages are the most popular.

       3. What is our inventory turnover rate, and how does it compare to industry standards?
		Power BI can be used to connect to inventory data, create visualizations such as line charts and bar charts to show inventory turnover rate over time, 
		and also use data mining techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data to understand how it compares to industry standards.
  
	4. How has our sales performance been over the last quarter, and what are the key drivers of that performance?
		Power BI can be used to connect to sales data and create visualizations such as charts and tables to show sales performance over time, and also use data mining techniques
 		to identify patterns and relationships in the data to understand what factors are driving sales.

      5. How many customer complaints have we received in the last month, and what are the most common issues customers are complaining about?
		Power BI can be used to connect to customer complaint data, create visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts to show the number of 
		complaints over time, and also use data mining techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data to understand the most common issues customers are complaining about. 




     It goes beyond descriptive and predictive analytics, which provide insights and predictions, by providing specific recommendations on what actions to take.
